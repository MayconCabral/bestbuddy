<h1 align="center">BEST BUDDDY</h1>
<p>Looking for a daily dose of dog cuteness? Best Buddy got you covered with over 10,000 adorable pictures! is a front-end application that consumes the <a href="https://dog.ceo/">Dog.Api</a> - the internet's biggest collection of open source dog pictures. Showcasing the best images of dogs on the web while expressing the unique bond between dogs and humans.</p>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<h3 align="center">Best Buddy was built using the following front-end technologies:</h3>
<p><strong>React.js:</strong> A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allowed us to create a fast and dynamic experience for users.</p>
<p"><strong>Sass:</strong>A CSS preprocessor that allowed us to write more maintainable and organized stylesheets, with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.</p>
<p"><strong>React Router:</strong> A library that provided client-side routing capabilities for our single-page application, allowing users to navigate between different views without reloading the page.</p>
<p><strong>Axios:</strong>A lightweight and flexible HTTP client library that allowed us to fetch data from the Dog.API and handle API requests with ease.</p>
<p>Together, these technologies enabled me to build a responsive, visually appealing, and performant front-end that showcases the best images of dogs and the love between dogs and humans.</p>
<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The design of Best Buddy aims to convey the warmth, joy, and playfulness that dogs bring into our lives. I used a playful color palette with shades of blue associated with trust and shades of orange associated with energy, warmth, and playfulness. The layout is simple and intuitive, with a search bar and a button that allow users to browse dog images by breed.</p>
<p>But Best Buddy is more than just a pretty interface. It showcases the amazing diversity of dogs and the deep emotional connection between dogs and humans. Today, dogs are not just pets but also emotional support animals and service dogs that assist people with disabilities. They offer comfort, love, and loyalty to their human companions, often becoming an important part of the family. With each image, Best Buddy hopes to capture a little bit of the joy, love, and loyalty that dogs offer to us every day.</p>
